                        How to build the Xen Live CD

    These scripts were made to help us set up and run the live-build to create
 a new Xen Live CD.

    You must to be root to run this steps properly, since live-build do some
 chroots, mounts, etc...

    The live-build used is 4.0.3-1 from Debian Jessie.

    NOTE: If you wish to build the 64 bits version of the Xen Live CD, you must
 be on a 64 bits machine.


    Makefile build process:

 1- Run "make i386|amd64" to create your Xen Live CD image under i386 or amd64
   subdir;

 2- Opcional: Run "make plusguests-i386 | -amd64" to copy some guests into the
   live;


    To build the Xen Live CD step-by-step:

 1- Unpack xenlivecd-VERSION.tar.gz under /usr/src;

 2- cd /usr/src/xenlivecd-VERSION/[i386|amd64];

 3- Run ./10-init-lh_config.sh to prepare the base for live-helper;

 4- Run ./13-package-list.sh to generate the package list that will end up
    being installed on the live system.

 5- Run ./15-copy-some-stuff.sh to copy some stuff to be included in your dom0;

 6- Run ./20-run-lh_build.sh as first step in the iso creation;

 7- Run ./30-prepare-binary-for-xen.sh to copy Xen to the CD root directory;

 8- Run ./31-remove-kernel-of-chroot.sh to remove initrd and vmlinuz from the
   dom0 compressed squash file system. This will save ~20MB in the final iso,
   since these files are copied by the live-helper to the final disc image.

 9- Run ./32-get-windows-gplpv-drivers.sh to copy the drivers to the final ISO;

 10- Optional: Run ./33-copy-guests.sh to copy previous installed domUs; *

 11- Optional: Run ./34-copy-source-to-iso.sh to copy the ISO generator to the
    final ISO;

 12- Run ./35-remake-iso.sh to remake the final Xen Live CD iso image.


    To clean all and start over again, run "make dist-clean" from top level
 source directory. Note that the caches of the ".deb" files will not be
 deleted.


    About source sub directories

    The sub directories i386 and amd64 contains all files used in the build
 process of the Xen Live CD, one directory for each arch. The sub directory
 arch-common contins some files shared between the two archs.

    The directory "stuff" contains all the stuff needed for the dom0 and the
 domUs work properly and some scripts and the Xen logo.

    The directory sutff/Xen has two sub directories, the dom0 and the domU.
 The files there must be copied to the root of the dom0 and of the domUs
 respectively.

 dos Santos.

    Some tips:

    If you have a 64-bit CPU but little memory, try using the i386 version of
 the Xen Live CD with the Xen 64 bits. With this you'll have a 32-bits dom0 on
 top of a 64-bits hypervisor. In this case, you no longer need the libc6-xen
 package in any of your domains (dom0 and domU). Ending with the problem
 related to TLS. The libc6-xen is only required in pure 32-bit systems.

    You only need a 64 bits dom0 if you give to it, 4G of RAM or more (aka
 dom0_mem=4096M). It's not a good idea to have a 64 bits O.S. with low memory
 for its operations.


  * The process of creating the domUs included in the Xen Live CD is outside of
 the scope of this work. But it is perfectly possible to create the Xen Live
 CD with no virtual machines pre-configured on it. But you can find the
 necessary files in the "guests" within the Xen Live CD and copy them to the
 directory "xenlivecd-XY/guests" of the source code and then run the step 2 via
 makefile mode or 12, if you choose step-by-step mode.
